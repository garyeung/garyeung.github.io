Hey there. This is Gary Yeung, a self-taught programmer. 

Like a lot of developers, I'm captivated by code and the amazing things it can create. But my passion goes beyond the lines of a text editor; I'm more interested in the space where computers and humans meet, and the core principles of computer science that make it all possible.

I started this blog to share my journey, my code, and my thoughts. This is a place to document my learning process, dive into topics that spark my curiosity, and explore a few ideas that come to me along the way.

 I hope you find something here that inspires you to think differently, too : \)
